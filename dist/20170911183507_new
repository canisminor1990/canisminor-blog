{"title":"Release Candidate... Released!","body":"\nToday Quill enters its highly anticipated 1.0 release candidacy. Through the 11 beta releases, over 300 reported bugs were fixed, and almost 1000 commits were made. Thank you to all contributors who pitched in, in ways small and large, isolated and numerous, either reporting issues, committing code, or otherwise helping out the community!\n\nThe API should now be considered stable, with only backwards compatible bug fixes to look forward to. No additional new features are planned until after the official 1.0 release."}
